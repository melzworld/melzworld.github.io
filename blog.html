     Sooooooooo. I hadn't touched this in months, and I finally found time to get back on. <br>
     Turns out I've forgotten how far I've gotten on React, and I had a bunch of updates. <br>
     Instead of manually updating one at a time, Anthony told me I could do this:<br>
     <q>sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y</q>
     I had to do it 3-4 times because of connectivity issues.  But it worked.<br>
